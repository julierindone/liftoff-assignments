# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am creating a web-based task app to help people who struggle with organization, and are simultaneously helped and hindered by to-lists. It will allow users to create nested task lists which can be hidden or viewed as needed, filter the list by tags, and have user-chosen reward items or images pop up for additional motivation.

### Features
Include Features here
+ User login
+ Open and close nested lists independently
+ Filtering - Tagging tasks, and being able to filter the list in customized ways
+ Text descriptions of reward to-dos (snack, video game, etc) that are hidden until certain tasks are complete
+ Reward gifs, graphics or badges for checking off tasks – customizable by the user for extra buy-in

### Technologies
•	C#
•	ASP.NET MVC
•	SQL
•	HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
•	Use a GIF API so users can add their own reward gifs (and store favorites in a library for reuse? This is probably not MVP-level)
•	REACT (or go back and improve Angular skills)
•	User authentication to keep user information safe
• Probably several other things I don't have a name for yet!
